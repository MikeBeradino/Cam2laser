r=1000 # THIS MUST BE THE FIRST LINE IN THE FILE! 
# The "r=number" command sets the speed in points per second (pps) at which samples are displayed by the Lasershark. 
# The pps speed can be set to any integer between 1 and the maximum value as reported by the Lasershark (64000)   
# You should not set this value to be greater than what your galvos are capable of operating at.
# 	Failure to adhere to this guidance can result in galvo damage or decreased lifespan.

e=1 
# The "e=" command sets the output enable state of the Lasershark. The output enable status must be set for any
# laser or galvo control to occur.
#	"e=1" == enable
#	"e=0" == disable
#
p=Prints a text string to the console
#
s=1,1,1,1,1,1 
# The "s=" command adds a sample to the sample buffer to be written out to the Lasershark.
# A sample defines galvo positioning and laser intensity for a particular point to be displayed. 
# The format is "s=X,Y,A,B,C,INTL_A"
# The ranges for these fields are X=[0-4095],Y=[0-4095],A=[0-4095],B=[0-4095],C=[0,1],INTL_A=[0,1]
# For A and B (analog laser control outputs), 0 means the output is off and 4096 means the output is at full power
# 	1024 would indicate 25% output power, 2048 would indicate 50% output power, etc.
# For C (TTL laser control output) 0 means the output is off and 1 means the output is on
# For INTL_A (Interlock A) 0 means the output is off and 1 means the output is on (for ttl)
# Samples are queued until they fill a full lasershark packet and are then written out to the lasershark.
# This means that to ensure ALL samples are written out, a flush should be performed once all desired samples are 
# written out.
#
f=1 # Flushes all samples. It is reccomended to stick this at the end of your output file to ensure all samples are displayed.
